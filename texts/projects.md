**Lector in eBooks (working title)**

_Year: In preparation_

_Funds: to be determined( expected budget ~350'000€)_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanities Informatics // University of Bologna_

**Background** With this project, we aspire to understand the reader's experience related to each emotional tone analyzed in the texts, inferring how reading dynamics have changed over space and time. We will also be able to apply profiling algorithms to both users and characters in literary fiction to learn what correlations exist between the two profiles. All the links that will emerge, characterizing the preference of each reader in choosing and enjoying the e-reader, according to different times, ways, spaces, will be part of the other investigative and productive aspect of the project. We believe that one of the most critical phenomena in society lies precisely in the lack of consideration of the relationship between readers and e-readers and how to transform digital reading into an experience that can exploit the potential of the device.

**Peirce interprets Peirce : A Methodological Inquiry into Automatic Manuscript Analysis -2023**

_Year: 2023_

_Funding: 845,000 CHF (submitted)_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanities Informatics // Bibliotheca Hertziana - Max Planck Institute for Art History Archive // University of Groningen // Harvard University_

**Background**: The project will focus on the analysis of the manuscripts of Charles S. Peirce, a scholar known for American pragmatism and contemporary semiotics. The project will use web technologies, text analysis and visualization to examine Peirce's legacy. It will work with Peirce's manuscripts held at Harvard University's Houghton Library, using a new digitization process to study the unknown portion of the collection. Subsequently, a digital editorial flow using automatic natural language processing, semantics and data visualization will be implemented to illuminate Peirce's thought. The result will be available to the public, both scholarly and non-scholarly.

**The Seven Sages of Rome in the Medieval World - 2022**

_Year: 2022_

_Funding: 21,000 CHF_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanities Informatics_ 

**Background:** This project aims to collect bibliographic data from a variety of sources to create a database of manuscripts and early printings containing the Seven Sages of Rome, along with the approximate location and date of their production. The data will be used to create a series of maps and other visual products showing the spread of the Seven Sages in the centuries following the Middle Ages. An overarching goal will be to contribute to the current turn in medieval studies away from national histories and toward a new appreciation of the connections and transfer points that link the broader pre-modern world.

**Hackathon for the Montreux Jazz Memories Heritage - 2022**

_Year: 2022_

_Funding: 8000 CHF_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanistic Informatics // the EPFL Cultural Heritage & Innovation Center, Montreux Jazz Archive_

**Background**: The Department of Humanistic Informatics at the University of Lausanne, in collaboration with the EPFL Cultural Heritage & Innovation Center and the EPFL College of Humanities, organized a Code Hackathon to enhance the collection and enhancement of the memory of the Montreux Jazz Festival community through a public and digital history project (Montreux Jazz Memories). The main objective is to provide the user with an output that emphasizes the cultural heritage of the data through the support of automatic methods for generating useful and relevant information.

**CROSSINGS: computational interoperability for intangible and tangible cultural heritage -2021**

_Year: 2021_

_Funding: 60,000 CHF_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanities Informatics // EPFL Laboratory of Experimental Museology // Bibliotheca Hertziana - Max Planck Institute for Art History_ 

**Background**: Since UNESCO affirmed the importance of intangible heritage in 2003, efforts to model folklore, tradition, experience and other forms of cultural heritage have been scarce. The primary goal of this project is to explore the potential for standardizing the consumption of tangible and intangible cultural heritage by instantiating an intangible heritage use case for the Hong Kong Living Martial Arts Archive (a collaboration between EPFL's Experimental Museology Laboratory and the Goushou International Association). It will do so by developing an ontological model of intangible heritage that combines aspects of haptics, pose and movement with traits of tradition and folklore, and generating a connected knowledge graph for Kung Fu heritage.

**Models of musician mobility and migrating musical patterns -2020**

_Year: 2020_

_Funding: 60,000 CHF_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanistic Informatics, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Laboratory of EPFL_

**Background**: Drawing on a sample of composers from the period 1600-2000 from the Digital and Cognitive Musicology Laboratory (DCML) corpus initiative, the project aims to develop formal metamodels of the multifaceted phenomenon of human mobility and mobility of ideas such as musical patterns. Unlike previous approaches, we seek to model mobility in ways that reflect its geopolitical complexity, account for uncertainty and conflicting interpretations, and are computationally feasible using Semantic Web technologies.

**French Lexis in the Auchinleck Manuscript: A Digital-Philological Approach - 2020**

_Year: 2020_

_Funding: 21,000 CHF_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanities Informatics_ 

**Background**: This project seeks to problematize the connection between language and nation that has become common in readings of the Auchinleck Manuscript. In particular, it considers the French lexicon used in the manuscript texts and the relative novelty of its appearance in Middle English contexts. Our main goal is to match the more than 17,000 lexical entries in the Auchinleck Manuscript with Middle English Dictionary headwords in order to extract and sort information about the etymology of the words in the manuscript and their earliest dates of mention in Middle English. If it can be shown that a significant portion of the lexicon in the Auchinleck Manuscript consists of recent French imports, to what extent can the manuscript be said to be "in English"?

**The Digital Humanities ToolKit : A python library for the digital humanities - as of 2018**

_Year: as of 2018_

_Partners: UNIL-Department of Humanities Informatics_ 

**Background**: The Internet is a great source for searching and retrieving this kind of information, and archives such as Project Gutenberg, Europeana, Archive.org, and Similia provide many datasets relevant to researchers. However, many of these resources are organized and structured in different ways and are often incompatible, having different APIs and different metadata structures, making these repositories difficult to exploit. With the introduction of the Digital Humanities Tool Kit (DHTK), we propose a new python library whose purpose is to overcome these limitations by providing an intuitive tool for large-scale study of large cultural databases, leveraging state-of-the-art computational methods to support and simplify research in the digital humanities. Tool produced in the Programming for the Humanities course I taught.


## <a name="partecipation"></a> Participation in national and international research groups

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Universität Magdeburg (Under review)**

**Role** : Research Partner

**Background** : In this project, the goal is to access, digitize and index the holdings of Ingetraut Dahlberg's special library and create a digital tool to enable content analysis. The library contains works that Ingetraut Dahlberg collected throughout her life as a researcher, information scientist, editor, publisher, and founder of the "Gesellschaft für Klassifikation e. V." (GfKl) and as founder of the "International Society for Knowledge Organization" (ISKO) on knowledge organization in the years 1970-1997. In addition to literature, the collection also includes conference and journal papers, which will also be digitized. In addition, he developed a universal classification system, the Information Coding Classification (ICC) [9], for knowledge organization. By the time of Dahlberg's death, the system encompassed about 6500 fields of knowledge and was well known in Germany and internationally. As part of this project, the ICC is to be updated to include new knowledge areas and made available to the public in machine-readable form.

**Activities** : 
* Structuring the semantic Web with codes from the CCI. 
* Evaluating approaches to pictorial representation of knowledge areas with their subdivision possibilities.
